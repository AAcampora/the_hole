text = "— INTRODUCTION:
On behalf of the Sydney Mining Conglomerate,
we at Headquarters would like to thank you, Inmate, for undertaking the role of WARDEN at our Athenosphere Super Bore-Hole Research Facility,
commonly known as THE HOLE.

We understand this decision was made through your penitentiary’s Re-Integration Program,
and we sincerely hope your time with us will assist in your rehabilitation,
allowing you to return to society as a law-abiding and productive citizen.

— RESPONSIBILITIES:
As WARDEN, you are the Keeper of the Gates.
Your position is of utmost importance. You are tasked with overseeing and monitoring all activities within the Athenosphere Super Bore-Hole Facility (THE HOLE) and its surrounding operational sectors.

Your duties include maintaining system integrity, performing routine maintenance, and executing research directives issued by the Research Division as they become available.

Your primary directive is simple:

KEEP THE INNER FACILITY SECURE AT ALL COSTS.

Failure to uphold this directive will result in immediate dismissal and return to your former penitentiary, in the event that the WARDEN survives such failure.

— FACILITY HISTORY:
The Athenosphere Super Bore-Hole Facility (ASBH) represents one of the Sydney Mining Conglomerate’s most ambitious engineering achievements to date.

The SMC Research Division initiated excavation during the “Gates of Hades” Mega Project, a continuation of the historic Kola Superdeep Borehole—a Soviet endeavor terminated in 1995 due to budgetary constraints and the technological limits of its era.

Following the Advent of Daemon-Core Technology in 2080, alongside SMC’s patented Ultra-Black Super Steel Alloy, the question naturally arose: what are the true limits of these technologies?

As a controlled stress test of these technologies, Project Gates of Hades was reopened with a singular objective—
to triple the depth achieved by the original Superdeep Borehole.

The result: THE HOLE.

The current phase of excavation has exceeded all prior theoretical limits. Our operations have achieved a measured vertical depth of 86 kilometers, placing the drill head at the upper boundary of the Earth’s Athenosphere.

CLASSIFIED MATERIAL NOTICE
The following information is restricted to personnel of CLEARANCE LEVEL OMEGA or higher.
Unauthorized access, duplication, or dissemination will result in maximum punitive action permitted under Global Corporate Law 44.8.

At this unprecedented depth, SMC researchers have recorded anomalous readings inconsistent with established geological models. Early data suggests that the Athenosphere contains a hollow region of considerable size—its structure unlike any known terrestrial formation.

Initial sub-surface scans indicate the hollow region extends approximately 300 kilometers downward, though no definitive end has been located. The region emits a low-frequency resonance detectable across multiple instruments, occasionally interfering with comms and telemetry.

Attempts to introduce drones and probes have yielded inconsistent results, with several devices transmitting non-geological signatures before ceasing function entirely.

— ATHENOSPHERE ENTITY ENCOUNTERS —

Throughout the investigation of the Athenosphere, at Checkpoint DIS (approx. 86 km depth), acoustic surveys detected anomalous sound propagations within the hollow super-cavern.

These signals have been collected and subjected to extensive filtration and spectral analysis. The results remain inconclusive, though several notable findings have been catalogued:

Certain audio fragments appear to contain phonetic structures consistent with archaic human languages, including High Latin, Aramaic, Akkadian, Phoenician, and several unclassified dialects.

Recovered drones from exploratory missions show evidence of manual alteration and non-random damage patterns. Tool marks and distortions suggest deliberate handling, as though an external entity had attempted to inspect or understand their composition.

Further research is ongoing.

INCIDENT REPORT — MAY 24, 2145
During scheduled maintenance of the Primary Bore Entry, personnel observed the emergence of an Athenospheric Anomalous Entity (AAE-01).

The entity exhibited extreme hostility, resulting in 23 fatalities and 4 critical injuries among on-site technicians.

The Athenosphere Super Bore-Hole Facility was immediately placed under emergency lockdown. Through trial-and-error deployment of existing defensive systems, the AAE was ultimately neutralized.

Subsequent autopsy and containment reports remain CLASSIFIED.

Following the incident, SMC management issued directive ASBH/OMEGA-LOCK, authorizing the creation of a permanent Warden position to ensure ongoing security and monitoring of the Borehole."
